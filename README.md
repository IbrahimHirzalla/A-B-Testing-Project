Task: 
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.


Instructions for completing the task
Describe the goals of the study.
Explore the data:
Do types need to be converted?
Are there any missing or duplicate values? If so, how would you characterize them?
Carry out exploratory data analysis:
Study conversion at different stages of the funnel.
Is the number of events per user distributed equally among the samples?
Are there users who are present in both samples?
How is the number of events distributed among days?
Are there any peculiarities in the data that you have to take into account before starting the A/B test?
Evaluate the A/B test results:
What can you say about the A/B test results?
Use a z-test to check the statistical difference between the proportions.
Describe your conclusions regarding the EDA stage and the A/B test results.
